## Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS3 
* Bootstrap 4
* Font Awesome
* Google Fonts
* Microsoft Word (Templates) for my menus.

## Testing
* W3Schools HTML/CSS validator. Picked up a few small errors eg: extra > and unclosed CSS tags in two areas.
* Tested across multiple device sizes.
  Found on smaller screen sizes (e.g: Galaxy Fold, iPhone 5,SE) the hero image and hero text were too large, 
  off center or at times took over the screen view. Also the reviewer images were distorted when skrunk down.
  After speaking with my mentor Brian Macharia, he suggested that maybe my image size was unsuitable for what 
  I was trying to do and how if I changed the size of my downloaded image it might suit better.
* Also during testing I discovered that I needed to insert @media queries for my form and menu pages as they were not 
  responding correctly on small devices.
* I also recieved feed-back about the font selection from friends who felt the font I had originally selected
  did not suit the site.
